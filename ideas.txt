random seed => generate solar system:
    - star type
    - number of planets
    - mass of each planet
    - distance from sun for planets
    - ore richness of each planet


planet temperature at ground level affects smelting energy cost

make satellite deployment time "realistic" / depend on launcher distance to target orbit
+ allow creating lasers to push satellites into their orbit?
=> can give reason for gas planets to exist (I think powerful lasers use excited gaz) (though we could just have rocky planets have atmospheres)
+ make this a mod / content pack / config option



"unlock" sim time by progressing through tutorial/objectives:
  - each parallel sim consumes ticks? going back in time to change something forks into a parallel timeline, maybe by default? (<- user setting would be preferable)
  - could determine how many ticks can be kept in memory as well? might just not be fun


data needed to save/load/clone a timeline:
 - *!*recorded player commands*!*
 - snapshots, events? every T ticks before and after a player command
 - construct fabrication. well, maybe instead we need satellite launches and constructed count changes


2+ simulations UI:
 - part of the ui should visualize the existing timelines:
   - shared parts of timelines should be clearly delineated as such
   - the player should be able to "select" 1+ timelines.
   - distinguish where each timeline has been "fully" simulated? (instead of stripped to the minimum data needed for persistence&recreation)
 - part of the ui should visualize the "selected" timeline(s):
   - graph events, snapshots, commands?
   - might need to restrict max number of points drawn
